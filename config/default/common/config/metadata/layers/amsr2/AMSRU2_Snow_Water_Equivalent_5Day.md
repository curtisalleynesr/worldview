The AMSR-U2

This AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified Level-3 (L3) data set provides 5-day maximum estimates of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). SWE was derived from brightness temperature measurements acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on board the JAXA GCOM-W1 satellite.

indicates the amount of water that is contained in snowpack in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres measured in millimeters (mm). Another way to think of it is if all the snow were melted instantaneously, it would be the depth of that water. The snow water equivalent layer is useful for assessing the amount of water that is present in the snowpack and can be used to assess surface runoff when the snow melts and to assess water availability for regions in lower elevations.

The SWE data is rendered to an azimuthal 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) for both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

Note: This data set uses JAXA AMSR2 Level-1R (L1R) input brightness temperatures that are calibrated, or unified, across the JAXA AMSR-E and JAXA AMSR2 L1R products.
