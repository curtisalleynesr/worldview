The AMSR-U2

This AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified Level-3 (L3) data set provides monthly mean estimates of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE). SWE was derived from brightness temperature measurements acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on board the JAXA GCOM-W1 satellite.

The SWE data is rendered to an azimuthal 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) for both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

Note: This data set uses JAXA AMSR2 Level-1R (L1R) input brightness temperatures that are calibrated, or unified, across the JAXA AMSR-E and JAXA AMSR2 L1R products.
